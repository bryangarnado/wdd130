        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Bryan Garnado" width="200">
        <p>Hello! I'm Bryan Garnado from Bataan, Philippines, currently living in Abu Dhabi, UAE. After 15 years, I'm thrilled to dive back into education through the BYU Pathway program, currently pursuing my first certificate in Web Fundamentals.</p>
        <p>At first I thought, I would not be able to continue learning because of my work schedule then suddenly things changed after I found out this program of the church that helps me continue my studies and learn new skills. I am grateful for this program and I want to set good examples to my children on the importance of education</p>
        <p>I am married to a beautiful woman who supports me on my goals and I am a father to three beautiful children. In my free time, I love playing with my kids, going to the park and helping my wife doing household chores including cooking.</p>
